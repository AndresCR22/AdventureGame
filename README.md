**Overview** <br>
  This project is a text-based adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world reminiscent of the Fallout universe. The game    offers an immersive narrative experience where players make critical decisions that determine their fate. Players navigate   through treacherous environments like a ruined city and a barren desert, facing the consequences of their choices.

**Files** <br>
  - game.py: The main Python file containing the game's logic and narrative structure.

**Getting Started** <br>
  To get the Wordle Clone up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the Repository <br>
     ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-adventure-game.git``` <br>
     ```cd text-adventure-game```

  3. Run thr Game <br>
      ```python game.py```

  4. Start Playing <br>
     Once the script is running, follow the prompts in the terminal to begin your adventure. You will be presented with     
     choices that guide your journey through the city or the desert. Your decisions will shape the outcome of the game, so 
     choose wisely!

**Features** <br>
  - Interactive Storyline: The game offers a branching narrative where every choice has consequences.
  - Multiple Endings: Depending on your decisions, you can reach different outcomes.
  - Immersive Atmosphere: Descriptive text paints a vivid picture of the post-apocalyptic world, enhancing the player's   
                          immersion.
  - Replayability: With multiple paths to explore, the game encourages replaying to experience all possible outcomes.

**Why This Clone?** <br>
  The primary purpose of creating this text-based adventure game is to practice and demonstrate skills in Python   
  programming. By developing a game with a complex narrative and decision-making, this project serves as a practical example 
  of:
  - Conditional Logic: Implementing branching paths based on user input.
  - User Interaction: Handling player choices and providing feedback.
  - Text-Based UI: Creating a simple yet engaging text-based user interface.
